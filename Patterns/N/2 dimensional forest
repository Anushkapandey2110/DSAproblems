<h2>question<h2>
Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.

An N/2-dimensional forest is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with ‘*’.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N/2-dimensional forest.

<h2>solution<h2>
void nForest(int n) {
	int i,j;
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		for(j=0;j<=i;j++)
		{
			cout << "*" <<" ";

		}
		cout << endl;
	}
	// Write your code here.
}
