description:
A number N is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number N, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to N.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 
1 which is less than equal to N. The second 
number is 2 which is less than equal to N,
but the third factorial number is 6 which 
is greater than N. So we print only 1 and 2.

solution:
    vector <long long> fnum;
    long long pro=1;
    long long i=1;
    vector<long long> factorialNumbers(long long N)
    {
        pro *= i;
        if(pro > N)
        return fnum ;
        else
        {
            i++;
            fnum.emplace_back(pro);
            return factorialNumbers(N); //since the function is returning a vector value and it's return type is not void we cannot simply call the function.
        }
        
    }
