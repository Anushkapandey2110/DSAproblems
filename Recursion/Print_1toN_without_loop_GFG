description:
Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively
solution:
void printNos(int N)
    {
        if(N<=0)
        return;
        printNos(N-1);
        cout << N << " ";
        
        
    }
